^ Effective devs are the ones that communicate well - in their code,
^ in their work, and about their struggles.

# Communication

* Programming _languages_
* Know your audience: computer, team, client, self
* Learn to teamwork

# _Tech_

^ Good programs can be written in any language. People will hate on PHP or javascript or ruby
^ or any number of things. I will too at some point; call me out.

# Tech

* You are not your tech stack
* Focus on fundamentals: _problem solving_ and _communication_
* Choose the right tool for the job
* Always be learning

^ Please help me with microagressions like "you guys"
^ We're going to push hard, but I'd much rather you grabble with failure here than on the job

# Safety

* Review the [code of conduct](https://github.com/TIY-DC-ROR-2015-Jan/course-notes/blob/master/README.md#code-of-conduct)
* Respect each other, help each other
* Respect your self: know your comfort zone, get enough sleep

# _Expectations_

---

# Expectations

* Different students will have different metrics for success
* Keeping you supported and challenged is my job; letting me know when I'm not doing that is yours
* If you need more help, structure, pairing, code review, practice, time to absorb ... ask for it

---

# Expectations

* At some point in the class you will struggle
* When you do, you will communicate that
* 15 minute rule

---

# Expectations

* If you ping me before 5, I'll respond before I leave
* If you message me after hours, I'll respond when I'm available
